* Algebraic method: https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/98275/5026 - note: in most questions, apparently, students are able to setup (n-1) equations for a system of n variables. turns out they never realize any reaction can have infinite solutions for balancing, and they need to start by assuming an integer value for one variable
